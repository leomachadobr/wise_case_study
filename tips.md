## What We're Looking For
### 1. A Clear, Defensible Demand Estimate:

For the demand estimation, it's great to brainstorm multiple methodologies. However, your final recommendation should not be a list of all possible options.
What to aim for: We want to see you make a decision. Please identify and justify one primary metric or a focused methodology that you believe is most effective for estimating demand. Explain why you chose it over other options. This shows us your ability to move from exploration to a concrete, defensible recommendation.


### 2. Insights Backed by Evidence:

Your analysis is a story, and data is your evidence. Every conclusion or insight you present must be directly supported by data and, ideally, a visualization from your analysis.
What to aim for: Don't just state a conclusion. Guide us to it. For example, instead of just saying "X is lagging," say "X is lagging, driven by X seen in Chart X." Explicitly reference your charts and data points to make your argument compelling and easy to follow.

### 3. Go Deep, Not Just Wide:

Surface-level analysis isn't enough to drive action. We're looking for you to dig into the data to find the "why" behind the numbers.
What to aim for: Break down the top-line metrics. Segment the data by key dimensions provided (e.g., region, platform, experience). Often, the most critical insight is hidden in a specific slice of the data. The goal is to identify a root cause, not just describe overall trends.

### 4. Make Your Code Accessible:

A common and easily avoidable hiccup is sharing-permission issues. We want to see your work, so please make sure we can access it!
What to aim for: Before you submit, please double-check that any links to your work (like a Google Colab notebook, GitHub repo, or presentation) are set to "Anyone with the link can view."

### 5. Frame Actionable Recommendations:

The ultimate goal of our analysis at Wise is to help product teams make better decisions. Your conclusions should be practical and focused on what the team should do next.
What to aim for: Based on your key finding, what is your recommendation? Should the team investigate a bug? Re-evaluate a user flow? Double down on a specific market? Be specific about the next steps.
We provide these tips because we want you to succeed. We're looking forward to seeing your unique approach and how you think.
